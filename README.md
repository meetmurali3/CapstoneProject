This is a frontend application for the Insurance application developed using Ionic Framework. This application helps users of the application create car insurance policies.
This is a tool that will be used internally in an insurance firm, and users of the application are Underwriters and Underwriter assistants. 
The tool will allow the users to enter insured information (interested party) and enters their vehicle information and finally provides insurance policy.

This is the UI frontend developed in Ionic Angular framework to have the capability to not only work on web browsers for now, but will have the chance of extending this to mobile apps. Most of the application code utilizes typescripts and routing mechanism provided my Angular.

To start the application execute the command ionic -serve. It opens a new broswer with the application login page.
